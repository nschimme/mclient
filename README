Installing
==========
To make it go, run ./build.sh (Linux/Mac) or winbuild.bat (Windows).

If everything builds smoothly the binary should be located within
the build or winbuild directories.


MingW Problems
==============
Install zlib with MSYS and then copy the files in MSYS' /mingw to the
MingW installation in the Qt directory.


Visual C++ Problems
===================
A simple batch file like this fixed most of my issues:

@ECHO OFF
SET QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2008
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Qt\2009.03-msvc\bin
SET ZLIB_LIBRARY=C:\Dev\zlib-1.2.3
SET ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\Dev\zlib-1.2.3


Additionally, it is possible to speed up the Qt installation process with Visual C++ using JOM. JOM is available at:
